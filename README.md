A set of [Bevy]-native networking crates, focused on providing robust and rock-solid data transfer
primitives.

# TODO

- how do users handle draining msgs?
  - if the user doesn't drain recv_msgs, is that a warn? unbounded growth?

# Goals

- Native to Bevy ECS
  - Network state is represented as entities, making them easily queryable
  - React to connections and disconnections via observers
  - Send and receive data by mutating components
- Correct and non-panicking
  - Explicit error handling, where failure conditions are clear and documented
  - No `unwrap`s - all panicking paths are a bug unless explicitly documented
- Support for any network topology
  - Dedicated server/client, listen server, peer-to-peer
- Swappable IO layer
  - Use whatever you like as the underlying byte transfer mechanism
  - You can use multiple IO layers at the same time, e.g. Steam + WebTransport

High-level networking features such as replication, rollback, and prediction are explicit
**non-goals** for this crate. Instead, this crate aims to provide a solid foundation for
implementing these features.

# Overview

## Layers

`aeronet` is fundamentally split into multiple layers:
- [session layer](crate::session)
  - Defines what a [`Session`] is
  - Handles core dis/connection logic, shared among all IO implementations
  - Performs setup for the layers above
- [IO layer](crate::io)
  - Establishes and maintains a connection to a peer
  - Detects connection and disconnection, and reports it to the session layer
  - Allows sending and receiving packets unreliably
  - User-swappable - example implementations: [`aeronet_channel`], [`aeronet_webtransport`]
- [Transport layer](crate::transport)
  - Handles fragmentation, reliability, and ordering of messages
  - Splits messages into packets, and reassembles packets into messages, which can be used layers
    above
  - Allows receiving acknowledgement of sent message acknowledgements
  - Technically user-swappable, but most code above this layer relies on [`aeronet_transport`]
    specifically
- Component replication, rollback, etc.
  - This is not provided as part of `aeronet`, but you can use a crate which integrates `aeronet`
    with one of these e.g. [`aeronet_replicon`]

## Getting started

To learn about how to use this crate, it is recommended that you learn the architecture by skimming
the examples and reading the documentation of important types such as [`Session`]. If you're not
sure where to start, take a look at the [`echo_client`] and [`echo_server`] crates. The examples are
designed to be self-contained and self-documenting, giving you an easy jumping-off point for
learning.

Crates and items are thoroughly documented through rustdoc, and are the most likely to be up to
date, so you should use that as the definitive reference for information on specific items.

Once you have a rough idea of the architecture, choose an IO layer implementation from the list at
the top, add it and `aeronet` to your app, and start building!

# Testing

## For `aeronet`

TODO: we need fuzz tests for the transport!

## For users

### Visualizer

As a debug tool, you may want to see the state of your session over time while you are in the app.
If using `aeronet_transport`, you can use the `visualizer` feature to enable an [`egui_plot`]
visualizer which displays statistics on sessions. This includes data such as round-trip time and
packet loss percentage.

### Conditioning

Using a conditioner allows you to emulate poor network conditions locally, and see how your app
copes with problems such as duplicate or lost packets, delay, and jitter.

Some example tools you may use are:
- Linux
  - [`tc`](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/configuring_and_managing_networking/linux-traffic-control_configuring-and-managing-networking)
    - `sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 250ms`
    - `sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem delay 200ms 50ms distribution normal`
    - `sudo tc qdisc add dev lo root netem loss 50%`
    - `sudo tc qdisc delete dev lo root`
- MacOS
  - [`dummynet`](https://superuser.com/questions/126642/throttle-network-bandwidth-per-application-in-mac-os-x)
- Windows
  - [`clumsy`](https://github.com/jagt/clumsy)

`aeronet` does not provide support for conditioning within the networking crate itself, since
conditioning testing is more effective (and representative of real-world results) when the
conditioning is applied at the lowest level possible.
