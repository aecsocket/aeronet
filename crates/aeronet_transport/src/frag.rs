//! Handles splitting large messages into smaller fragments, and reassembling
//! fragments back into messages.
//!
//! Packets are limited in size, usually to ~1000 bytes over a network. To be
//! able to send larger messages, we need a strategy to break down a large
//! message into smaller fragments, and send those fragments as packets over
//! the network (see [`split`]). On the receiving end, we combine these
//! fragments back up in order, and reassemble them into a full message (see
//! [`FragmentReceiver`]).
