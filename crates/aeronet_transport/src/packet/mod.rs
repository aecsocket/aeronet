//! Defines the structure of packets on the wire.
//!
//! This module only contains the type definitions themselves, to make it easy
//! to understand the whole protocol at a glance, and to have centralized
//! documentation on how the protocol works. The actual logic is implemented in
//! different modules.
//!
//! This file should be ordered in a way that makes it easy to understand the
//! protocol when reading top-to-bottom.
//!
//! The layout of a single packet is:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! struct Packet {
//!     header: PacketHeader,
//!     fragments: [MessageFragment],
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This is not defined as a struct since we don't read all fragments in advance
//! and then process them; that would require pointlessly allocating a [`Vec`]
//! to store the fragments. Instead, the logic looks like:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! fn process_packet(packet: &[u8]) {
//!     process_header(&mut packet);
//!     while !packet.is_empty() {
//!         process_fragment(&mut packet);
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
