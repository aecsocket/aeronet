//! Provides guarantees on message delivery and reception.
//!
//! Packets are not guaranteed to have any guarantees on delivery or ordering -
//! that is, if you send out a packet, there is no guarantee that:
//! - the packet will be received by the peer
//! - the packet will be only be received once
//! - packets are received in the same order that they are sent
//!
//! (Note that receiving a packet is guaranteed to contain the exact same
//! content that was sent, without any corruption, truncation, or extension -
//! this is guaranteed by the IO layer.)
//!
//! Instead, these guarantees are provided when sending out *messages* out over
//! a *lane*. There may be multiple lanes on a single session, and they provide
//! guarantees on:
//! - reliability - the message is guaranteed to be received by the peer once,
//!   and only once
//! - ordering - messages sent on a specific are guaranteed to be received in
//!   the same order that they are sent
//!   - note that ordering *between* lanes is *never* guaranteed
//!
//! The name "lane" was chosen specifically to avoid ambiguity with:
//! - TCP, QUIC, or WebTransport *streams*
//! - MPSC *channels*
//!
//! Note that lanes provide a *minimum* guarantee of reliability and ordering.
//! If you are using an IO layer which is already reliable-ordered, then even
//! unreliable-unordered messages will be reliable-ordered. However, in this
//! situation we still need lanes as they are a part of the protocol - we can't
//! just ignore them for certain IO layers.
