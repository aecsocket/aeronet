/// Manages sending and receiving messages on top of an IO layer.
///
/// The IO layer allows you to send and receive packets (see
/// [`aeronet_io::packet`]), but packets do not provide enough guarantees to be
/// usable for many use cases. [`Transport`] builds on top of packets, allowing
/// you to send and receive messages with more reliabiliy and ordering
/// guarantees via lanes (see [`lane`]).
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// After [`Session`] is added to your entity, you should create and add a
/// [`Transport`] component - use a [`Trigger<OnAdd, Session>`] for this. If
/// you are using a crate like `aeronet_replicon`, this step will already be
/// handled for you. You can also add or mutate [`TransportConfig`] at any
/// time during the session lifetime to change its configuration.
///
/// The [`Transport`] itself may disconnect the session prematurely if there
/// is an error such as running out of memory or buffering too many messages.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// - Use [`Transport::send`] to enqueue messages for sending, and to get a key
///   identifying the sent messages
/// - Use [`Transport::recv`]'s [`TransportRecv::msgs`] to drain messages
///   received from the IO layer
/// - Use [`Transport::recv`]'s [`TransportRecv::acks`] to drain message
///   acknowledgements for messages which you have sent out, and that the peer
///   has now acknowledged that they have received.
///
/// The `recv` buffers must be drained on every update, otherwise some may be
/// lost, leading to incorrect behavior, and a warning will be logged.
