An in-memory channel transport implementation of aeronet, using
[`crossbeam-channel`](https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel) for the MPSC implementation.

This transport can be used in any environment, native app or WASM, however cannot communicate with
other computers remotely over a network. This transport is useful when developing a local
singleplayer server for a potentially multiplayer game, as it allows you to write the same logic
without caring about if the server you're connected to is remote or local.

# Getting started

See [`aeronet`] for getting started with any transport. Create a [`ChannelServer`], which will
handle client connections. Then create and connect a [`ChannelClient`] to this server. You can
access the client's key via its state, to disconnect it from the server later.

```rust
use aeronet::{
    client::{ClientTransport, ClientState},
    server::ServerTransport,
    bytes::Bytes,
    lane::LaneIndex,
};
use aeronet_channel::{
    client::ChannelClient,
    server::{ClientKey, ChannelServer},
};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
struct AppLane;

impl From<AppLane> for LaneIndex {
    fn from(_: AppLane) -> Self {
        Self::from_raw(0)
    }
}

let mut server = ChannelServer::new();
server.open().unwrap();
let mut client = ChannelClient::new();
client.connect(&mut server).unwrap();

let msg = Bytes::from_static(b"hi!");
client.send(msg, AppLane).unwrap();

let ClientState::Connected(client_state) = client.state() else {
    unreachable!();
};
let client_key = client_state.key;

server.disconnect(client_key, "app closing");
```

[`ChannelClient`]: client::ChannelClient
[`ChannelServer`]: server::ChannelServer
