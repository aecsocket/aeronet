/// Provides a platform-agnostic way to spawn futures for driving the
/// WebTransport IO layer.
///
/// Using WebTransport sessions requires spawning tasks on an async runtime.
/// However, which runtime to use exactly, and how that runtime is provided, is
/// target-dependent. This resource exists to provide a platform-agnostic way of
/// spawning these tasks.
///
/// # Platforms
///
/// ## Native
///
/// On a native target, this holds a handle to a `tokio` runtime, because
/// `wtransport` currently only supports this async runtime.
///
/// Use the [`Default`] impl to create and leak a new `tokio` runtime, and that
/// as the [`WebTransportRuntime`] handle.
///
/// If you already have a runtime handle, you can use
/// `WebTransportRuntime::from(handle)` to create a runtime from that handle.
///
/// ## WASM
///
/// On a WASM target, this uses `wasm-bindgen-futures` to spawn the future via
/// `wasm-bindgen`.
///
/// Use the [`Default`] impl to create a new [`WebTransportRuntime`] on WASM.
