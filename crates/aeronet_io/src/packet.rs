//! Transmission of unreliable byte sequences (packets) along a [`Session`].
//!
//! # Packets
//!
//! A packet is a sequence of bytes sent from one [`Session`] to another (its
//! peer).
//!
//! Guarantees:
//! - the contents of the packet will be the same on the receiving side as the
//!   sender side.
//!   - this means the packet may *not* be truncated, extended, or otherwise
//!     corrupted.
//!   - it is the IO layer's responsibility to detect this, attempt to correct
//!     it, or drop the packet.
//!
//! Non-guarantees:
//! - the packet may not be sent.
//! - the packet may not be received by the peer.
//! - the packet may not arrive in any fixed amount of time.
//! - the packet may arrive out of order relative to other packets.
//!
//! # Maximum transmissible unit (MTU)
//!
//! The maximum length of a sent packet is called the maximum transmissible
//! unit. The MTU varies for different IO layers, but all IO layers guarantee
//! that they provide two MTU values:
//! - a current MTU value, which may vary over the lifetime of the session.
//! - a minimum MTU value, which the current MTU value may never drop below, and
//!   which itself may never change *over the lifetime of a session*.
//!   - this does not mean that the minimum MTU is constant for a given kind of
//!     IO layer, just that it may not change after a session is started.
//!
//! This value may even be [`usize::MAX`] (if using e.g. MPSC channels). Code
//! which uses the packet MTU must be resilient to being given any MTU value.
//!
//! A networked transport may choose to use [`IP_MTU`] as a base MTU value,
//! minus protocol overhead.
